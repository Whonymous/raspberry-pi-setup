3.4: HDMI output
===

### Video performance

If video output sucks, it's not a bad idea to run `raspi-config` and give 128Mb memory to the GPU (under 'advanced settings').


### Always-on HDMI

If you want your Pi to continuously show something (like) a website in kiosk mode), you'll notice that the screen will automatically turn off after a while of inactivity. You might also experience that nothing shows after turning your monitor on. To make sure HDMI-output is always on, do the following (from [here][always-on]). It should make sure that a) HDMI output is active even when the monitor is off and b) doesn't turn it off again after a while of inactivity.

Add this line to `/boot/config.txt`:

	hdmi_force_hotplug=1

Before you close the file, you might also want to enable audio over HDMI in the same file, [as described below][audio]. When done, reboot.

**Note: when the Pi boots to terminal, you'll need to follow [these steps below][terminal] as well to prevent the screen going blank.**

#### Prevent terminal blanking ([source][term-blank])

When booting into the terminal, the screen will go black after a while. To prevent this, edit `/etc/rc.local`. Above the `exit 0`, insert:

	setterm -blank 0 -powerdown 0 -powersave off

#### Prevent screensaver 

It sucks if you don't have a mouse or keyboard attached to the Pi, and it shows a screensaver. To disable, use the solution found [here][prevent-screensaver] and [here][x-power]: 

First, install needed packages:

	sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils

Next, edit `/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart` and comment out the line that says `@xscreensaver -no-splash`. Also add the following:

	@xset s off
	@xset -dpms
	@xset s noblank

### Fix audio over HDMI ([source][hdmi-audio])

If your monitor or tv has speakers but the sound is not working, make sure the following line exists in `/boot/config.txt`:

	hdmi_drive=2

If the file contains `hdmi_drive=1` instead, change the `1` to a `2`. This makes sure a normal HDMI output (with audio) is used instead of DVI mode (without audio). You'll probably want that if you use your Pi as a home theater box.

### Launch website in kiosk mode (fullscreen)

The following explains how to launch a website in kiosk mode. Make sure you have followed the steps above to keep HDMI-output always-on and the screensaver always-off. Since Chrome (or in this case: Chromium) is a rather heavy browser for the Pi, you might want to consider using a more lightweight one that supports kiosk mode, but since I don't know any, here's how to do it using Chromium:

Start by installing Chromium and Unclutter (to hide the mouse cursor):

	sudo apt-get install chromium unclutter

Edit `/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart` and add:

	@chromium --kiosk --incognito http://howcoldisit.com

The `--incognito` is used to make sure it loads freshly on reboot, e.g. in case you have changed JS or CSS files and are unable to Ctrl+F5 the thing for lack of attached keyboard.

**Note: this launches for every user that logs in in desktop mode. For a per-user auto-launching application, use [this][peruser].**

#### Hide the mouse pointer
To hide the mouse pointer when running in kiosk mode, apt-get install `unclutter` if you haven't done so in the previous step and add the following line into `/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart`:

	@unclutter -idle 0.1 -root


### Boot to GUI for new user ([source][boot-gui])

In case you want to boot into a different use account, one specifically for the kiosk-mode instead of the default `pi` user, you should first make sure that booting to desktop is enabled (instead of to the command line or to Scratch) by running `raspi-config`. Do the following to add a user named 'kiosk':

	useradd kiosk
	passwd kiosk

Then edit this file:

	sudo nano /usr/bin/raspi-config

And search for this line:

	do_boot_behaviour() {

Edit the 16th line by replacing `pi` with the new username:

	sed /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf -i -e "s/^#autologin-user=.*/autologin-user=pi/"
