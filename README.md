Raspberry Pi Guide
===

*A guide to stuff you might want to do when you get your Raspberry Pi, stuff that you otherwise might forget to do, or stuff that is a pain to do when you find out you should have done them earlier.*

Disclaimer: I'm not a Raspberry Pi guru, or even someone who knows a lot about Linux in general, but when I got my Pi I had to figure out many things about both that would be a waste for any other non-guru to also figure out for themselves. So here they are, jotted down for your and my future reference.

I'm assuming a freshly installed Raspbian image, although other Debian-based versions shouldn't be much different.

### 1. First things first

Keep your monitor and keyboard attached to the Pi until you've done this part.

1. [Before anything else][1.1]: making sure the entire SD card is used, update everything.
2. [WiFi][1.2]
3. [Basic security][1.3]: disable root over SSH, change default password, enable two-factor authentication.
