Raspberry Pi Guide
===

*A guide to stuff you might want to do when you get your Raspberry Pi, stuff that you otherwise might forget to do, or stuff that is a pain to do when you find out you should have done them earlier.*

Disclaimer: I'm not a Raspberry Pi guru, or even someone who knows a lot about Linux in general, but when I got my Pi I had to figure out many things about both that would be a waste for any other non-guru to also figure out for themselves. So here they are, jotted down for your and my future reference.

I'm assuming a freshly installed Raspbian image, although other Debian-based versions shouldn't be much different.
