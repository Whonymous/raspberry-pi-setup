3.2 External NTFS harddisk
===

This part explains how to get an external drive working with you Pi, when the drive is formatted as an NTFS drive. Not that the USB-ports of the Pi are not capable of delivering much power to external devices, so if your drive has its own powersupply make sure to use it.

#### Mounting the drive.

By default, the Pi does not support NTFS. Install NTFS support like this:

    sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g

Create a mountpoint where you want to access your drive, e.g. `/media/hdd`:

    sudo mkdir /media/hdd

Next you'll need the name of your drive; run the next command and look for a name like `sda`, `sda1` or `sda2`, etc.:

    sudo fdisk -l

Use the mountpoint and drive name to mount the drive. You can do so manually by typing `mount /dev/sda1 /media/hdd` (replace the names where necessary), but since it needs to be mounted on every boot automatically you need to edit [**fstab**][fstab]:

    sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add the following line to auto-mount on boot:

    /dev/sda1       /media/hdd      ntfs-3g auto,async,noatime,defaults,user,noexec,rw              0       0

Replace name and mountpoint where necessary. Now, the drive will automatically mount when booting the Pi.


#### Troubleshooting

If the drive has become unmounted for some reason (like detaching and re-attaching) and you want to re-mount all drives listed in fstabm, you can do so using one command:

    sudo mount -a
    
If that fails with an error saying that `/dev/sda1` can't be found, it may help to run `dmesg` and try `mount -a` again. If that doesn't work either, run `lsusb` to check if the drive is actually properly attached. `lsusb` lists all USB devices; if your drive is not in the list it may be detached or turned off.

When the drive gets corrupted (e.g. due to a power outage halfway through a write operation), the regular `fsck /dev/sda1` that might help to fix a Linux drive will fail with an error like 'fsck.ntfs-3g not found' when the drive is an NTFS drive. Here's a fix:

	sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g, ntfs-config, ntfsprogs, testdisk
	sudo ln -s /bin/ntfsfix /sbin/fsck.ntfs
	sudo ln -s /bin/ntfsfix /sbin/fsck.ntfs-3g

Make sure those paths are correct by consulting `which ntfsfix` and `which fsck`, because some tutorials suggest **/usr**/sbin/ntfsfix instead.

Now run `fsck` again, and omit the `-f` flag.

If fsck then still fails by saying that the disk can be mounted and that 'chkdisk' should be run, then:

	sudo apt-get install testdisk
	sudo testdisk
	
and follow the instructions on the screen to look for partitions on the drive and rewrite the corrupted partition table.
