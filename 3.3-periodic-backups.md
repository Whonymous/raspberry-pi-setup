3.3 Periodic Back-ups
===

The SD card that carries the Pi OS isn't always as reliable as you'd like it to be. Sudden power loss, for example, can corrupt your card to the point where it won't boot your Pi any longer. Combine this with the lack of a power button and you might be tempted to just unplug your Pi when moving it about; a recipe for disaster.

#### Safely shutting down the Pi

If you need to unplug the Pi, make sure to call the following command before doing so:

    `sudo halt`
    
This will shutdown the Pi and make sure no write operations will be interrupted.
    

#### Backing up the entire SD card to external storage

The following is from [this post][backup1]. It will the entire SD card to an image stored on the external storage. Of course, you should make sure you have at least enough space available on the external storage before doing this.

To quote the words of caution:

> **Caution - be careful using the dd command, make sure you get the right syntax, particularily the if and of options, get them the wrong way round and your gonna need the backup you haven't taken!**

The following command stores the image in the root of the external drive and assumes it is mounted on `/media/hdd/' (as described [in 3.2][3.2]), you might have chosen yours differently.

    sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/media/hdd/

Beware: on my Pi, this took 8757.16 seconds for a 16Gb SD card. Yup, that's 2 and a half hours.

#### Periodic, automatic backups

Coming soon.
