5.1 Power Consumption
===

Because the Pi is meant as a low-power devices, and for some purposes you might even want to make it portable and power it using a battery instead of a power supply, here are some tips on how to make the Pi use as little power as possible. Most of this information was found [here][pizero].


### Disable HDMI

If you're using the Pi without a monitor, you can simple turn off HDMI output like so:

	/usr/bin/tvservice -o

(use `/usr/bin/tvservice  -p` to turn back on). Add the line to `/etc/rc.local` to make it permanent, otherwise it will only work until the next reboot.


### Disabe LEDs

They only use a tiny bit each, but if every milliamp counts... check [section 5.2][leds] on how to power off the LEDs.


### Minimize peripherals

Disconnect all peripherals you're not using, such as keyboards, mouse, webcam, etc.


### Underclock

Run `rpi-config` to simply underclock the CPU.


### Allow more power to USB devices

**A.k.a. "My external hard drive keeps bugging out and I think it might be due to power issues"**

The following will actually *increase* power consumption, but it might be useful nonetheless.

Some USB devices require more than the Pi delivers by default. E.g., a 2.5" external harddrive without its ow power supply will probably not work without the following fix (note: a **3.5"** external drive will definitively *not* work without its own power supply).

The default output over USB is 600mA. If you are certain that you have a decent power supply that delivers at least 2A, you can increase the maximum USB output to 1.2A by adding the following lines to `/boot/config.txt`:

* **Raspberry Pi B and older**

		safe_mode_gpio=4

* **Raspberry Pi B+ and Pi 2**

		max_usb_current=1

* **Raspberry Pi 3**

	Already hardwired to give 1.2A by default. ([source][pi3])
