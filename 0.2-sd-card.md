0.2 SD card
===

If you want to set up your Pi without attaching a display (a.k.a. 'headless'), then it should
automatically connect to the network on first boot and start listening to an incoming SSH connection.

Since November 2016, Raspbian does not have SSH enabled by default. You can [enable it manually][1.3] in non-headless mode, but there's an easier way: preparing the SD card before you put it in the Pi. The `boot` partition on the SD card is accessible by any OS, and you can use it to prepare SSH and WiFi.


#### Enable SSH

Simply put a file on the boot partition called 'ssh'. That's it:

> For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named ssh, without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card. When the Pi boots, it looks for the  ssh file. If it is found, SSH is enabled, and the file is deleted. The content of the file does not matter: it could contain text, or nothing at all. ([source][ssh])


#### WiFi

Similar method for WiFi. You can [set it up manually][1.3], or by simply putting a file on the boot partition ([source][wifi]):

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
	ssid="YourWifiNetwork"
	psk="SuperSecretPassword"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Or, when running an **older version than Raspbian Stretch**, the shorter version will do:

```
network={
    ssid="YourWifiNetwork"
    psk="SuperSecretPassword"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Edit the country code and the WiFi credentials and save this in a file called `wpa_supplicant` on the SD card. On first boot,
this file will automatically be picked up to configure the network.
