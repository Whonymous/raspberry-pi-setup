0.2 SD card

## Writing the image to SD

If you did not get a preconfigured SD card, you can download the image of any OS and write it to the SD card you intend to use for your Pi. In this repo, I use the [official Raspbian][raspbian]. When using Windows, I recommend the [win32diskimager][win32] tool to copy the image to the SD card. When using Mac or Linux, you can use the `dd` command.

Start by figuring out exactly which disk is your SD card, **so you don't accidentally overwrite the wrong disk**. On Mac, you can do this:

```
diskutil list
```

on Linux:

```
fdisk -l
```

Next, when you are sure which disk it your SD card, write the image to it. Be sure to edit the paths and disks to the correct ones in the following example:

```
sudo dd if=/path/to/image/file.img of=/path/to/sdcard bs=1m
```

In my case, this looks something like this:

```
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/raspbian.img of=/dev/disk7 bs=1m
```

This command will take a while, and won't give you any feedback while it is running! Just be patient for ten minutes or so. To get a progress bar, you may want to pipe `pv` inbetween (which can be installed with `sudo apt-get install pv` on Linux or `brew install pv` in Mac if you have Homebrew). The result will be similar to this:

```
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/raspbian.img | pv | sudo dd of=/dev/disk7 bs=1m
```

Or this, if you know you have a 5GB file:
```
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/raspbian.img | pv -s 5G | sudo dd of=/dev/disk7 bs=1m
```


## Back-up

Note that you can do the reverse of the command above to create a backup image of your SD card, for example like so:

```
dd if=/dev/disk7 of=~/Desktop/rpi_backup.img
```

On Windows, you can use win32diskimage tool instead.


## Modifying the SD card

If you want to set up your Pi without attaching a display (a.k.a. 'headless'), then it should
automatically connect to the network on first boot and start listening to an incoming SSH connection.

Since November 2016, Raspbian does not have SSH enabled by default. You can [enable it manually][1.3] in non-headless mode, but there's an easier way: preparing the SD card before you put it in the Pi. The `boot` partition on the SD card is accessible by any OS, and you can use it to prepare SSH and WiFi.


#### Enable SSH

Simply put a file on the boot partition called 'ssh'. That's it:

> For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named ssh, without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card. When the Pi boots, it looks for the  ssh file. If it is found, SSH is enabled, and the file is deleted. The content of the file does not matter: it could contain text, or nothing at all. ([source][ssh])


#### WiFi

Similar method for WiFi. You can [set it up manually][1.3], or by simply putting a file on the boot partition ([source][wifi]):

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
	ssid="YourWifiNetwork"
	psk="SuperSecretPassword"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Or, when running an **older version than Raspbian Stretch**, the shorter version will do:

```
network={
    ssid="YourWifiNetwork"
    psk="SuperSecretPassword"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Edit the country code and the WiFi credentials and save this in a file called `wpa_supplicant` on the SD card. On first boot, this file will automatically be picked up to configure the network.
