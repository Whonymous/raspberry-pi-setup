3.5: Analog video output
===

The Raspberry models B have a 3.5mm jack that looks like a regular headphone jack but is actually a 4-pins audio _and video_ jack. When configured correctly, you can use this to connect to an older tv without needing HDMI converter boxes. This analog video signal is also known as composite or s-video. 

Here follow the steps to get this working. You'll need a [4-pins a/v cable][amazonlink], which usually came (or still come) with DSLRs or video cameras.

### Edit the boot config

The easiest way to enable this is to edit the file `/boot/config.txt`. You can even do this before installing your Pi by editing
the file on the SD-card.

First, disable HDMI output by commenting or removing this line:

```
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
```

and adding this line:

```
hdmi_ignore_hotplug=1
```

This disables the HDMI output. Then find the following and uncomment it to enable analog video output:

```
#sdtv_mode=0
```

Set its value to one of the following:

- **0** - NTSC
- **1** - Japanese NTSC
- **2** - PAL
- **3** - Brazilian PAL

Save the file, and reboot your Pi to see the effects!

### During boot

There's another way that I weirdly never got to work (simply nothing happened). According to [this source][buttons] (amongst others), you can boot the Pi while holding shift, and then press the keys 1-4 to switch outputs.

### Toggle output

To toggle HDMI/analog video output on the fly, try the following commands:

Disable HDMI output:

```bash
tvservice -o
````

Enable composite output (example):

```bash
tvservice -e "PAL 4:3"
```

### Troubleshooting

Here are a few things you should know if the screen stays blank:

- Note that the **Pi 3 B(+) does not send an analog video signal over the 4-pins a/v jack**. I have not found a clear source on this other than some forum posts and the fact that I could not get it to work on my Pi 3B+. Allegedly the new 4 _does_ send analog video over the jack again.
- If you followed the steps above but your TV doesn't show anything, try reducing the output resolution using the `sudo raspi-config` tool. I've seen the video bug out on large resolutions and work correctly on 1024x720, even though that resolution is still larger than what both PAL and NTSC support.
- **As of July 2019, there are issues that break analog video output.** I've had success simply running `rpi-update`, however, if you're running RetroPie, that command will break the emulationstation! So if the instructions above are not working on your Retropie, [downgrade your kernel like so][retropie]: `sudo ~/RetroPie-Setup/retropie_packages.sh raspbiantools install_firmware 1.20190401-1`
- **Check your cable**. Different cables are connected differently. While usually the yellow tulip connects the video, and the white and red ones are left and right audio channels; you might also have a cable where red is the video channel. So make sure to try each tulip!
