3.5: Analog video output
===

The Raspberry models B have a 3.5mm jack that looks like a regular headphone jack but is actually a 4-pins audio _and video_ jack.
Note that the **Pi 3 B(+) does not send an analog video signal over the 4-pins a/v jack**. I have now found a clear source on this other than some forum posts and the fact that I could not get it to work on my Pi 3B+. Allegedly the new 4 _does_ send analog video over the jack again.

Here follow the steps to get this working. You'll need a [4-pins a/v cable][amazonlink], which usually came (or still come) with DSLRs or video cameras.


### Edit the boot config

The easiest way to enable this is to edit the file `/boot/config.txt`. You can even do this before installing your Pi by editing
the file on the SD-card.

First, disable HDMI output by commenting or removing this line:

```
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
```

and adding this line:

```
hdmi_ignore_hotplug=1
```

This disables the HDMI output. Then find the following and uncomment it to enable analog video output:

```
#sdtv_mode=0
```

Set its value to one of the following:

- **0** - NTSC
- **1** - Japanese NTSC
- **2** - PAL
- **3** - Brazilian PAL

Save the file, and reboot your Pi to see the effects!

### During boot

There's another way that I weirdly never got to work (simply nothing happened). According to [this source][buttons] (amongst others), you can boot the Pi while holding shift, and then press the keys 1-4 to switch outputs.

### Troubleshooting

If you followed the steps above but your TV doesn't show anything, try reducing the output resolution using the `sudo raspi-config` tool. I've seen the video bug out on large resolutions and work correctly on 1024x720, even though that resolution is still larger than what both PAL and NTSC support.
