4.4 Bluetooth keyboard
===

Personally, I'm using my Pies solely over SSH so I don't need a keyboard to control it. Which makes it all the nicer to, in case something goes wrong and I can't access it over SSH anymore, I can pull up a cheap bluetooth keyboard and not have to switch my main keyboard. Maybe you're doing the same, or maybe you have aportable Pi or something like that. Anyway, here's what I did:


### Installation

Plug in your bluetooth dongle and check if it is recognized by typing `lsusb`. On an existing keyboard or SSH, that is.
If it isn't, unplug and replug or reboot and try again.

Next, install the needed tools:

    sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez-utils blueman
    
Now make the bluetooth keyboard discoverable and find out its MAC address by typing

    hcitool scan
    
Type the following to start pairing the device:

    bluez-simple-agent hci0 YO:UR:MA:CA:DD:RE:SS

When requested, enter a short pin number (on the non-bluetooth keyboard) and hit enter. You won't get any confirmation or prompt next, but immediately after you can type the same PIN and hit enter on the bluetooth keyboard as well. Trust the device definitively and connect to it:

    bluez-test-device trusted YO:UR:MA:CA:DD:RE:SS
    bluez-test-input connect YO:UR:MA:CA:DD:RE:SS

It might take a few seconds, but then it works!
When you reboot the Pi or turn off/on the keyboard, it should automatically reconnect.
