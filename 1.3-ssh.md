1.3 SSH fingerprint
===

I assume you want to do most things over SSH, since the Pi is not a desktop replacement and will propably reside somewhere under your desk or closer to a router than to a monitor and keyboard. In case you're not paranoid you can skip this step, otherwise execute the following in a terminal to see your RSA fingerprint:

		ssh localhost

Write it down or remember the first and last few characters. Later, once you SSH into the Pi you can compare the fingerprints and be sure there's no Carol intercepting Alice and Bob's messages.
