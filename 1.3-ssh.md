1.3 SSH fingerprint
===

I assume you want to do most things over SSH, since the Pi is not a desktop replacement and will propably reside somewhere under your desk or closer to a router than to a monitor and keyboard. In case you're not paranoid you can skip this step, otherwise execute the following in a terminal to see your RSA fingerprint:

		ssh localhost

Write it down or remember the first and last few characters. Later, once you SSH into the Pi you can compare the fingerprints and be sure there's no Carol intercepting Alice and Bob's messages.


### Disable root over ssh

Open `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` and find:

		#LoginGraceTime 2m
		#PermitRootLogin no
		#StrictModes yes
		#MaxAuthTries 6

Uncomment the line with `PermitRootLogin no`. While you're in that file, also ensure `Protocol 2` is enabled. Next, restart the ssh daemon to apply the changes:

	sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart

Done! You'll need to log back in (when doing this over SSH).


### Keep SSH connections alive for longer

Edit `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` again. Add this at the bottom of the file:

		ClientAliveInterval 30
		TCPKeepAlive yes
		ClientAliveCountMax 99999

And restart ssh: `sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart`.


### Disable root entirely

You can change the default root user password using

		sudo passwd root

...or better yet, disable root user:

		sudo passwd -dl root

You can disable root user because your default (root-capable) user will probably be user 'pi'. Don't forget to also change the default password for pi in the same manner.
