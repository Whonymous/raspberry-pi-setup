4.6: Control a camera
===

Using the *gPhoto2* tool and a usb-connected digital camera, you can automatically take pictures using your Pi to create, e.g., a time lapse video. The stuff described below achieves something similar to what can be done using *Motion* (check [the section on Motion here][motion]) but where Motion is targeted to creating security cameras using webcams, gPhoto2 is geared towards controlling digital cameras.


### gPhoto2

gPhoto is a tool that can control a usb-connected camera. Check [here][compatible] for a list of compatible cameras. Let's install using the familiar: `sudo apt-get install gphoto2`. Connect your camera using the usb-cable, turn it on, and check if it is connected:

		gphoto2 --list-config

This will give you a list of supported settings and actions. You can figure out how to use those settings using `gphoto2 --get-config {name}`. For example, if `--list-config` lists the setting `/main/settings/iso` then you can get a list of possible values for this setting using:

		gphoto2 --get-config iso

Next, you can set either of those values using the shown choice numbers:

		photo2 --set-config iso=7

#### Taking pictures

If the camera is set, take a picture and download it to your Pi:

		gphoto2 --capture-image-and-download --filename "%Y%m%d%H%M%S.jpg"


#### Create timelapse


		gphoto2 -I 10 -F 600 --capture-image-and-download --filename "%Y%m%d%H%M%S.jpg"

This sets the camera to take a picture every 10 seconds, and take 600 pictures in total. For me, this command consistently got stuck at the 10th picture, with the camera indicating it was writing a picture to the SD-card but never finishing the operation. This unfortunately forced me to set a cron job to take pictures.

After taking some pictures, the images should be combined into a video file. The [source][gphoto2] mentioned earlier also describes how to do that, using MEncoder.
