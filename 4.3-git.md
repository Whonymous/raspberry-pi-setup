### Generate SSH keys

You can use Git by entering a password on every push and pull, but using SSH keys is both easier and more secure.
If you don't have a SSH key pair yet, you can generate them as follows:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
    
(Note that [there's more info on GitHub][ssh], including how to generate keys on Windows and Mac.)

### Set up a Git server

Once, setup a user account for git:

    sudo adduser git
    mkdir /home/git/repos/

Run all the following commands as this new git user:

    sudo -s -u git
    
Now, configure the SSH keys:

    cd ~/
    mkdir .ssh
    cat /my/public/key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    mkdir repos


### Set up a new repository:

For each new repo, :

	cd ~/repos
	mkdir projectname.git
	cd projectname.git
	git init --bare	

Now you can commit files from another computer:

	mkdir projectname
	cd projectname
	git init
	git remote add origin git://git@<ipaddress:port>/home/git/repos/projectname.git
	git add .
	git commit -m "initial commit"
	git push origin master

**Note: when using a different port for SSH**, you have to use the ssh:// prefix instead of the git:// prefix.

If you're going to access the repo from inside and outside the LAN, e.g. from home and from work on the same laptop,
you probably want to add two origins, e.g. originwan and originlan; the first with your outside ip and the other
with the local ip of your pi.


### Added security

Quoting [this][git-shell]:

		As an extra precaution, you can easily restrict the 'git' user to only doing Git activities with a limited shell tool called `git-shell` that comes with Git. If you set this as your 'git' user’s login shell, then the 'git' user can’t have normal shell access to your server. To use this, specify git-shell instead of bash or csh for your user’s login shell.

To do so, edit `/etc/passwd`, find the line with 'git' in it and change `/bin/sh` or `/bin/bash` to `/usr/bin/git-shell`. (Use `which git-shell` to check if you got that path right.) Now user *git* can no longer SSH into the RPi, but you can still `sudo -s -u git` from another users shell session to, e.g. add another repo.


### Configuring SSH keys on a Linux client

To get your SSH keys working on a Linux client, first copy them to the `.ssh` folder in your home directory and make them readable to only you:

	cp /my/public/key.pub ~/.ssh/id_key.pub
	cp /my/public/key.ppk ~/.ssh/id_key
	chmod 700 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	chmod 700 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Then, create and edit `~/.ssh/config`:

	Host {ip address of your pi}
		User git
		Hostname {ip address of your pi}
		PreferredAuthentications publickey
		IdentityFile "~/.ssh/id_rsa"

You should now be able to push and pull to and from your pi without using a password.
