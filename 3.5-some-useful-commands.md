3.5 Some useful commands
===

This sections is a bit of a random collection of commonly used terminal commands. Many if not most are probably known to Linux users or already mentioned in other sections, so consider this a short summary of miscellaneous commands and things that would go missing when only mentioned in a specific topic someplace else.


### Manage

- Instead of `su`: `sudo -s` (su doesn't work with the root user disabled)
- Monitor system resources: `top`
- See currently logged in users: `w` or `w username`
- Check system uptime: `uptime`
- Memory usage: `free`
- Disk space: `df -h`


### Networking

- See IP and MAC-address: `ifconfig`
- See external IP: `curl icanhazip.com`
- See gateway: `route -n`
- Use **netstat** to see open ports: `netstat --listen`
- To display open ports and established TCP and UDP connections, enter:	`netstat -vautn`
- To see full dns hostname, remove the -n flag: `netstat -vat`


### Updating

Update packages and OS:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Update firmware:

	sudo rpi-update


### User management

Add user: `adduser username`, edit password: `passwd username`


### Custom commands (aliases)

Add a line to `~/.bash_aliases` with a custom shortcut, e.g:

	alias mycommand='~/path/runsomescript.sh arg1 arg2'

Make sure `.bash_aliasses` is uncommented in `~/.bashrc`.


### Control disk space

Check disk space available on all drives with `df -h`. Check the size occupied by a folder using `du -sh /some/folder/` or use a wildcard to list all the content in a folder at once: `du -sh /some/folder/*`.

Clean disk space by removing apt-get caches and downloads, and by pruning obsolete packages:

	sudo apt-get clean
	sudo apt-get autoremove

`/var/log/` is a common evildoer in terms of eating precious SD card disk space. To limit the size of log files, edit `/etc/logrotate.conf`:

- change weekly to daily
- uncomment `#compress`

	
### Startup scripts

Scripts that should run as a background daemon on each startup must go in `/etc/init.d/`. Such a script should be able to process 'start' and 'stop' arguments, a simple example can be found [here][startup].

Make it executable (`chmod +x /etc/init.d/myscript`) and make it automatically start and stop it when the system boots or shuts down, like so:

	update-rc.d myscript defaults

To stop it from running automatically:

	update-rc.d myscript remove

### Cron

Cronjobs, tasks that are automatically repeated at set times, are explained in [the section about periodic backups][cron].
