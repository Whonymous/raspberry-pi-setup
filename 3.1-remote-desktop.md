3.1 Remote Desktop
===

### XRDP

	sudo apt-get install xrdp

It will start automatically and listen on port `3389`. Make sure to open the port on your router if needed, and
add the following rule to iptables (see the [section on firewalls][iptables] on how to do this):

	-A INPUT -p tcp --dport zzzz -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

Now you can login with using any remote desktop client.

[iptables]: ./2.1-iptables.md
