2.2 Auto-block login attempts (using fail2ban)
===

**[Fail2ban][fail2ban1]** is a tool that blocks and bans ip addresses that have failed certain criteria, such as too many failed login attempts. This is very useful for preventing brute-force password guessing. Fail2ban blocks ip addresses using the **iptables** firewall, so if you skipped the previous section on iptables, [go back there now][2.1].

[2.1]: ./2.1-iptables.md

Install:

	sudo apt-get install fail2ban

After this it should start automatically, otherwise start it as usual with `service fail2ban start`.

Fail2ban uses filters to filter relevant information from logs. The filters are located in `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/`, where you can add and edit the active filters. 

The fail2ban logs, where you can read what, when and why fail2ban has decided to block a remote address, are written to `/var/log/fail2ban.log`.

Whenever an ip is banned, it is 'sent to jail'. There can be several jails for different offenses and sentences. Check which jails are active using:

	fail2ban-client status

All default configurations are in the files `/etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf` and `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`. I suggest having a look at their content. To override their rules, don't edit the files directly but instead create a file for your own custom settings, using the `.local` extension (e.q. `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`).


### Unbanning an IP

If you ever find an ip banned by mistake, [here's][unban] a way to unban the ip without waiting. First, find the jail that's banning the ip:

	sudo iptables -L

It'll say `DROP` somewhere, followed by an ip or hostname. Above it will be the name of the jail, e.g. if it reads `fail2ban-ssh` the jail name will be `ssh`. Use the jail name and hostname/ip to unban it with the following command:

	sudo fail2ban-client get {jail name} actionunban {ip}
