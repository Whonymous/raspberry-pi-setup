4.1 Resilio Sync
===

[Resilio Sync][rslsync] (formerly BitTorrent Sync) is an awesome way of replacing Dropbox with your a self-hosted, peer-to-peer based, private version. If your concerned about the security or the closed-source nature of Sync you might be better of using [Syncthing][syncthing] instead, which is a bit more immature at the moment (in my opinion) but fully open source.


### Install

For security reasons it's usually best to install daemons as a separate user without root permissions. Let's create a user:

    adduser rslsync

Follow the steps, then `cd /home/rslsync` into the new user's home directory and download Sync:

    sudo -s -u rslsync
    wget https://download-cdn.resilio.com/stable/linux-arm/resilio-sync_arm.tar.gz
    tar -xzf resilio-sync_arm.tar.gz
    rm resilio-sync_arm.tar.gz
    ./rslsync --dump-sample-config >> rslsync.conf

#### Configure

You now have the executable in user `rslsync`'s home directory, with a configuration file called `rslsync.conf`. *Modify the configuration file to your wishes before you continue*. I use the following settings:

- `"disk_low_priority": true`,
- `"use_upnp" : false` because I configure my router manually,
- `"lan_encrypt_data": false` because encryption is though for the Pi,
- `"use_gui" : false` for extra security,
- `"folder_rescan_interval": 1800` because I never manipulate synced files on the Pi directly, scanning the synced folder isn't needed very often.
- modify the value for `"listening_port"` to a port you've opened for inbound traffic in [iptables][iptables].

#### Run

Next, you'll want the app to run as a daemon in the background and to automatically run on boot,
so for this purpose it's best to put a config file in `/etc/systemd/system/`.
[Here's an example script][service] that you can save as `/etc/systemd/system/rslsync.service`.

Save the script (and modify it to suit the correct paths if necessary), then use it to
start Resilio on boot:

	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl enable resilio
    sudo systemctl start resilio

You can now do the following:

- `sudo systemctl start resilio` to run Sync,
- `sudo systemctl stop resilio` to stop it,
- `sudo systemctl disable resilio` to remote Resilio from boot.


#### Run - pre-Jessie version

Unless you're running an old version of Raspbian, you won't need this.
Old versions did not use the SystemD version of running background services,
but System V Init. [Read more about the differences here][sysdiff].

Described below are the instructions for running Resilio as a System V Init script.

Start by putting a script in `/etc/init.d/`. [Here's an example script][script] that you can save as `/etc/init.d/rslsync`.

Once you have saved the script (and possibly modified it to your wishes), make it run on boot using the following:

    sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/rslsync
    sudo update-rc.d rslsync defaults

You can now do the following:

- `sudo service rslsync start` to run Sync,
- `sudo service rslsync stop` to stop it,
- `update-rc.d rslsync remove` to remote Resilio from boot.
