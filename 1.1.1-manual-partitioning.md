1.1.1 Expanding the partition size, alternative way
===

**Please only try the method described here if the one in [Before Anything Else][before] did not work!**

[before]: ./1.1-before-anything-else.md

The previous method gave me the error '*Your partition table is not currently supported yada yada*'. So here's an alternative.

	sudo df -h

This outputs something like the following

	rootfs          2.4G  2.1G  181M  93% /
	/dev/root       2.4G  2.1G  181M  93% /
	devtmpfs        211M     0  211M   0% /dev
	tmpfs            44M  268K   44M   1% /run
	tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
	tmpfs            88M     0   88M   0% /run/shm
	/dev/mmcblk0p5   60M   19M   42M  32% /boot

The `/boot` mount point indicated that `mmblk0p5` is the boot partition which should *not* be removed. We want to resize `/dev/root` instead.

Check the partition table:

	sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

and type `p` to see the partition table. Mine looked like this:

	Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 7822 MB, 7822376960 bytes
	4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 238720 cylinders, total 15278080 sectors
	Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
	Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	Disk identifier: 0x0000ee42
	
			Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
	/dev/mmcblk0p1            8192     2496093     1243951    e  W95 FAT16 (LBA)
	/dev/mmcblk0p2         2498560     7796735     2649088   85  Linux extended
	/dev/mmcblk0p3         7796736     7862271       32768   83  Linux
	/dev/mmcblk0p5         2506752     2629631       61440    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
	/dev/mmcblk0p6         2637824     7796735     2579456   83  Linux

As some instructions [here][stackoverflow1] read:

*Ahem*. I'm not seeing a swap partition on mine, but I'll ignore that. Your experience might be different. The partition of type `W95 FAT32` should be the same as the boot partition discovered earlier. If not, abort!

#### Delete all the partitions!

**Warning: screwing with partitions may lead to permanent data loss! I'm not reliable for any of it! Ha!**

First **make a note of where all the partitions start** (see the fdisk output).

Press `d` to delete a partition. Press `1` to delete the first one. Press `d` to delete another one. Continue until only the 4th remains (or whatever the W95 FAT32, the boot partition, is).

Type `n` to create a new partition. Press `p` to make it a primary one. Next `2`. Next, **enter the start number you memorized earlier**. When you're being asked about the last sector, hit enter to use the default.

I myself recreated the first extended partition at the same location (it might be swap, who knows) and the first primary partition from its old location all the way to the end.

When you're feeling good about your work, press `w` to write the partition table (this is usually where clusterfucks begin). Reboot: `sudo reboot`.

This should all work because only the partition table is being rewritten, while all the old data stays in place. Good luck.
