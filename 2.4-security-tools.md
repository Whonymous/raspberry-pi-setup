2.4 Security tools
===

Here are some commands you can use to keep an eye on security.

#### Failed login attempts

To check if anyone has attempted to log in, use this to check for failed attempts:

        cat /var/log/auth.log | grep Failed

#### Info

To check if your firewall is correctly configured, or to check which ports and addresses are currently connected, use:

        netstat -vautn

If you see any ports listed that you don't know or find suspicious, these might be some explanations:

- `123` - This is the **ntp** deamon, it checks online to keep your system clock on time.
- `3838` - When running Bittorrent Sync, this is the default port used for LAN search.
- `8080` and `8081` - There are usually used by web servers. If you're not running a server but are running **motion**, this might be used for its web-access. 

#### Network traffic

**iftop**, it's like `ifconfig` and `top` had a baby:

	sudo apt-get install iftop
	iftop
