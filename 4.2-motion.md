4.2 Webcam + Motion
===

[Motion][motion] is an awesome software motion detector, that you can use to set up an surveillance camera or (as I did) a timelapse video recorder..

### Webcam

Installing a webcam can be different for each make and model. There are [special camera modules][camera] for the RPi, but since I only have experience with a Microsoft Lifecam (which worked out of the box) I won't go into detail about those. Google is your friend here.

### Motion

Use Motion to configure the Pi to use a webcam for time-lapses or as a security camera. It is meant to take snapshots, compare frames and when motion is detected, record a video. It is very configurable.

Start by installing Motion:

    sudo apt-get install motion
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/motion/motion.conf
  
Edit the config file to your wishes, it is well documented. **Note: test the recordings before relying on them**. If the images turn up plain gray, you might want to set an image quality larger than 320x240. Depending on the amount of GPU memory set in `rpi-config`, the Raspberry can't handle large images.

Start running the motion deamon by setting '**yes**' in `/etc/default/motion`. Then start the deamon as you would with every daemon:

    sudo systemctl enable motion
